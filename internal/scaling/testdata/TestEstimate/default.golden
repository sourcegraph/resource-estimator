`### Estimate summary

* **Estimated total CPUs:** 35
* **Estimated total memory:** 54g
* **Note:** Use the default values for services or values not listed below .
* <details><summary>**IMPORTANT:** Cost-saving option to reduce resource consumption is available</summary><br><blockquote>
  <p>You may choose to use _shared resources_ to reduce the costs of your deployment:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>**Estimated total _shared_ CPUs (shared):** 8</li>
  <li>**Estimated total _shared_ memory (shared):** 10g</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p>**What this means:** Your instance would not have enough resources for all services to run _at peak load_, and _sometimes_ this could lead to a lack of resources. This may appear as searches being slow for some users if many other requests or indexing jobs are ongoing.</p>
  <p>On small instances such as what you've chosen, this can often be OK -- just keep an eye out for any performance issues and increase resources as needed.</p>
  <p>To use shared resources, simply apply the limits shown below normally -- but only provision a machine with the resources shown above.</p>
