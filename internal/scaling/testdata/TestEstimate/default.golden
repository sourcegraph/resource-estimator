`### Estimate summary

* **Instance Size:** XS
* **Estimated vCPUs:** 8
* **Estimated Memory:** 32g
* **Estimated Minimum Volume Size:** 1316g
* **Recommend Deployment Type:** Sourcegraph Machine Images

<small>**Note:** The estimated values include default values for services that are not listed in the estimator, like otel-collector and repo-updater for example. The default values for the non-displaying services should work well with instances of all sizes.</small>
* <details><summary>**IMPORTANT:** Cost-saving option to reduce resource consumption is available</summary><br><blockquote>
  <p>You may choose to use _shared resources_ to reduce the costs of your deployment:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>**Estimated total _shared_ CPUs (shared):** 8</li>
  <li>**Estimated total _shared_ memory (shared):** 8g</li>
  </ul><br>
  <p>**What this means:** Your instance would not have enough resources for all services to run _at peak load_, and _sometimes_ this could lead to a lack of resources. This may appear as searches being slow for some users if many other requests or indexing jobs are ongoing.</p>
  <p>On small instances such as what you've chosen, this can often be OK -- just keep an eye out for any performance issues and increase resources as needed.</p>
  <p>To use shared resources, simply apply the limits shown below normally -- but only provision a machine with the resources shown above.</p>
